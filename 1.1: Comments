1.1: Comments
(c) Jason Wiger, December 22, 2021

Introduction:

    Comments allow you to take notes in your code.

    Some good habits for comment-making:
    At the function level, use comments to describe what.
    At the block level, use comments to describe how.
    At the statement level, use comments to describe why.


Single-line comments:

    // this is a single line comment


    In practice:

    active|0|: integer func main() {
        Console.out("Hello, World!"); // prints 'Hello, World!'
        return default; // returns the default integer value for zero-initialization
    }

Multiline comments:

    /*
        This is a multiline comment.
        A multiline comment can span many lines.
    */

    In practice:

    active|0|: integer func main() {
        Console.out("Hello, World" /* oh yea, multiline comments don't cancel a whole line automatically like single-line comments do. */ );
        return default;
        /*
            Big old paragraph, i guess.
        */
    }

Conclusion and summary:

Single-line comments: // comment
Multiline comments: /* comment */
At the function level, use comments to describe what.
At the block level, use comments to describe how.
At the statement level, use comments to describe why.
